                Cerebroprotien.com operates as an online marketplace and advertising platform where licensed pharmacies carry on business and display their products and services to the public. The following terms and conditions (the "Terms of Sale") govern all sales of products and services (the "Products") offered by a participating pharmacy (the "Pharmacy") to you (the "Customer") on the Cerebroprotien.com platform. By accepting delivery of the Products described on a purchase order (an "Order"), the Customer agrees to be bound by and accepts these Terms of Sale.

Personal Examination.</strong> The Customer has personally attended, has had a physical examination by and has received a prescription from a duly licensed practitioner (the "Prescribing Practitioner") within the last 12 months and does not require an additional physical examination.</p>

            <p className="mb-4"><strong>2. Power of Attorney.</strong> The Customer authorizes and appoints the Pharmacy as its attorney and agent, to take all steps, sign all documents and to act on its behalf as if the Customer was personally present and acting for itself for the limited purposes of (a) obtaining a legally valid prescription for any prescription which the Customer had sent to the Pharmacy; and (b) packaging the Customer's prescriptions and delivering them to the Customer. The Customer's authorization shall include, but not be limited to, the collection of personal and personal health information and disclosure of such information to Cerebroprotien.com, the Pharmacy, the physician and any other health professionals being retained on behalf of the Customer, as required.

            <p className="mb-4"><strong>4. Shipping.</strong> Delivery of the Product to the Customer takes place when the product leaves the Pharmacy. After delivery, the Pharmacy will, as attorney and agent for the Customer, arrange for shipping of the product to the Customer's home address. Normally, the Customer's product shipment takes an average of 14 to 21 days to arrive. In the event that the Customer's shipment is delayed past 28 days, and upon notice from the Customer, Cerebroprotien.com will arrange with the Pharmacy to replace the delayed shipment, and the Pharmacy will re-deliver and re-ship the product to the Customer. Cerebroprotien.com is not liable for any damage to the Customer due to delay in shipment or failure of the product to arrive within 28 days.</p>
